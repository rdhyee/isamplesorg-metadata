## MaterialSampleRecord Predicates

### produced_by

**Type:** MaterialSampleRecord → SamplingEvent
**Cardinality:** One (required)
**Required:** ✅ Yes

#### Purpose
Links a material sample to the event that created/collected it. This is the **most important relationship** in iSamples - every sample must have provenance.

#### Controlled Vocabulary
Not applicable - targets a SamplingEvent node.

#### Usage Example

**YAML:**
```yaml
# Sample node
sample_001:
  otype: MaterialSampleRecord
  pid: "igsn:SSH000001"
  label: "Pottery sherd from Trench 5"

# Event node
event_001:
  otype: SamplingEvent
  pid: "event:2023-catal-t5-001"
  label: "2023 Excavation, Trench 5, Level 3"
  result_time: "2023-07-15"

# Edge
edge_001:
  otype: _edge_
  s: sample_001  # Subject: the sample
  p: produced_by # Predicate
  o: [event_001] # Object: the event
```

#### SQL Query Pattern

**Find all samples and their collection dates:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    event.pid AS event_id,
    event.label AS event_label,
    event.result_time AS collection_date
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'produced_by'
    AND edge.otype = '_edge_'
JOIN pqg AS event
    ON event.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord';
```

**Find samples collected in a specific time range:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    event.result_time
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge ON edge.s = sample.row_id AND edge.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND event.result_time BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

#### OpenContext Data Stats
- **Frequency:** 1,096,352 relationships (one per sample)
- **Unique subjects:** 1,096,352 samples
- **Unique objects:** 1,096,352 events (1:1 ratio)

#### Common Issues

❌ **Missing produced_by:**
```
Error: MaterialSampleRecord must have produced_by relationship
```
**Solution:** Every sample requires a SamplingEvent.

❌ **Multiple produced_by:**
```
Warning: Sample has multiple produced_by edges (should be one)
```
**Solution:** Cardinality is ONE - use `related_resource` to link derived samples.

### has_material_category

**Type:** MaterialSampleRecord → IdentifiedConcept
**Cardinality:** Many (required, minimum 1)
**Required:** ✅ Yes

#### Purpose
Classifies the physical material composition of the sample. Uses controlled vocabulary from iSamples Material Type Vocabulary.

#### Controlled Vocabulary
[iSamples Material Type Vocabulary](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/)

**Top-level categories:**
- Rock
- Mineral
- Organic material
- Liquid water
- Anthropogenic material (includes pottery, glass, metals)
- Biogenic non-organic material
- Natural solid material
- Soil
- Particulate
- Fluid (non-water)

**Example subcategories:**
- Rock → Igneous rock → Basalt
- Anthropogenic material → Pottery → Earthenware
- Organic material → Tissue → Bone

#### Usage Example

**YAML:**
```yaml
# Sample node
sample_001:
  otype: MaterialSampleRecord
  pid: "igsn:SSH000001"
  label: "Ceramic bowl"

# Concept nodes (from controlled vocabulary)
concept_earthenware:
  otype: IdentifiedConcept
  pid: "https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/earthenware"
  label: "Earthenware"
  scheme_name: "iSamples Material Type Vocabulary"

concept_anthropogenic:
  otype: IdentifiedConcept
  pid: "https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/anthropogenicmaterial"
  label: "Anthropogenic material"

# Edges (multivalued - can have multiple material types)
edge_001:
  s: sample_001
  p: has_material_category
  o: [concept_earthenware]

edge_002:
  s: sample_001
  p: has_material_category
  o: [concept_anthropogenic]
```

#### SQL Query Pattern

**Find all samples of a specific material type:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    concept.label AS material_type
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS concept
    ON concept.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND concept.label ILIKE '%earthenware%';
```

**Count samples by material type:**
```sql
SELECT
    concept.label AS material_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample.pid) AS sample_count
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge ON edge.s = sample.row_id AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS concept ON concept.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
GROUP BY concept.label
ORDER BY sample_count DESC;
```

#### OpenContext Data Stats
- **Frequency:** 1,096,352 relationships
- **Unique subjects:** 1,096,352 samples (one per sample)

**Top material types in OpenContext:**
1. Anthropogenic material (pottery, artifacts)
2. Rock (stone tools, building materials)
3. Organic material (bone, charcoal)
4. Soil (sediment samples)

#### Common Issues

❌ **Using free text instead of controlled vocabulary:**
```yaml
# Wrong:
has_material_category: "pottery"

# Right:
has_material_category:
  - pid: "https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/earthenware"
    label: "Earthenware"
```

✅ **Likely used:**
1. produced_by
2. has_material_category
3. has_context_category
4. has_sample_object_type
5. keywords
6. related_resource (parent-child samples)
7. sampling_site
8. sample_location
9. responsibility (SamplingEvent)

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **4 predicates are required** - produced_by, has_material_category, has_context_category, has_sample_object_type
2. **3 predicates involve coordinates** - sample_location, site_location (plus is_part_of for nested sites)
3. **3 predicates involve agents** - registrant, responsibility (SamplingEvent), responsibility (MaterialSampleCuration)
4. **2 predicates share names** - responsibility, has_context_category (different subjects)
5. **Different domains use different subsets** - Same schema, different instantiations

**Next steps:**
- [EXAMPLES_BY_DOMAIN.md](./EXAMPLES_BY_DOMAIN.md) - See these predicates in real-world examples
- [QUERYING_THE_GRAPH.md](./QUERYING_THE_GRAPH.md) - More complex query patterns
