## Understanding the Storage Model

### The Unified Table Structure

All nodes and edges are stored in a single table with these key columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pqg (
    row_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,    -- Internal identifier
    pid TEXT,                       -- Persistent identifier (for entities)
    otype TEXT,                     -- Object type: entity type OR '_edge_'
    s INTEGER,                      -- Subject row_id (for edges)
    p TEXT,                         -- Predicate (for edges)
    o INTEGER[],                    -- Array of object row_ids (for edges)
    n TEXT,                         -- Node value (for simple nodes)
    -- Plus entity-specific columns (label, description, etc.)
);
```

### Key Concepts

1. **Entities** have `otype` ∈ {MaterialSampleRecord, SamplingEvent, ...}
2. **Edges** have `otype = '_edge_'`
3. **Relationships** require joining through edge rows
4. **Multi-valued predicates** store multiple objects in `o` array

---

## Basic Entity Queries

### Count Entities by Type

```sql
-- Get counts of each entity type
SELECT
    otype,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM pqg
WHERE otype != '_edge_'
GROUP BY otype
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Example output (OpenContext data):**
```
otype                            count
MaterialSampleRecord          1,096,352
IdentifiedConcept             8,270,644
GeospatialCoordLocation       1,095,912
SamplingSite                    383,912
SamplingEvent                 1,095,912
Agent                            72,520
```

### Find Entity by PID

```sql
-- Look up a specific sample
SELECT *
FROM pqg
WHERE pid = 'iSamples:OPENCONTEXT:1b22b93b-...'
  AND otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord';
```

### List All Samples with Basic Info

```sql
-- Get first 1000 samples with labels
SELECT
    pid,
    label,
    description
FROM pqg
WHERE otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
LIMIT 1000;
```

---

## Single-Hop Traversals

### Pattern: Entity → Edge → Entity

For a single relationship, you need:
1. Start entity (subject)
2. Edge row connecting them
3. Target entity (object)

### Example: Find Sampling Events for Samples

```sql
-- Which sampling event produced this sample?
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    event.pid AS event_id,
    event.label AS event_label
FROM pqg AS sample
-- Join to edge
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'produced_by'
    AND edge.otype = '_edge_'
-- Join to target entity
JOIN pqg AS event
    ON event.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
LIMIT 100;
```

**Key pattern:**
- `edge.s = sample.row_id` - Edge starts at sample
- `edge.p = 'produced_by'` - Predicate identifies relationship type
- `event.row_id = ANY(edge.o)` - Handle multi-valued predicates
- Always filter by `otype` for performance

### Example: Find Material Categories for Sample

```sql
-- What material types does this sample have?
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    material.pid AS material_category_id,
    material.label AS material_category
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS material
    ON material.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    AND material.otype = 'IdentifiedConcept'
WHERE sample.pid = 'iSamples:OPENCONTEXT:...'
  AND sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord';
```

**Note:** `has_material_category` is **multivalued**, so a sample may have multiple material types. The `ANY(edge.o)` handles this array.

---

## Multi-Hop Traversals

### Pattern: Chaining Relationships

Many useful queries require following multiple edges:

```
MaterialSampleRecord
  --produced_by--> SamplingEvent
  --sample_location--> GeospatialCoordLocation
```

### Example: Samples with Coordinates (2-hop)

```sql
-- Find all samples with geographic coordinates
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    coords.latitude,
    coords.longitude,
    coords.elevation
FROM pqg AS sample
-- First hop: sample → event
JOIN pqg AS edge1
    ON edge1.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event
    ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
    AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
-- Second hop: event → coordinates
JOIN pqg AS edge2
    ON edge2.s = event.row_id
    AND edge2.p = 'sample_location'
JOIN pqg AS coords
    ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
    AND coords.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND coords.latitude IS NOT NULL
  AND coords.longitude IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Performance note:** This is the most common query pattern in iSamples - optimize it with indexes on `row_id`, `s`, `p`, `otype`.

### Example: Samples → Site Name (3-hop)

```sql
-- Get sampling site names for samples
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    site.pid AS site_id,
    site.label AS site_name,
    site_coords.latitude AS site_lat,
    site_coords.longitude AS site_lon
FROM pqg AS sample
-- Hop 1: sample → event
JOIN pqg AS edge1
    ON edge1.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event
    ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
    AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
-- Hop 2: event → site
JOIN pqg AS edge2
    ON edge2.s = event.row_id
    AND edge2.p = 'sampling_site'
JOIN pqg AS site
    ON site.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
    AND site.otype = 'SamplingSite'
-- Hop 3: site → coordinates
JOIN pqg AS edge3
    ON edge3.s = site.row_id
    AND edge3.p = 'site_location'
JOIN pqg AS site_coords
    ON site_coords.row_id = ANY(edge3.o)
    AND site_coords.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Design note:** `sampling_site` is optional in iSamples schema, so use `LEFT JOIN` if you want samples without sites.

---

## Aggregation and Statistics

### Count Edge Types in Dataset

```sql
-- Which relationship types are actually used?
SELECT
    otype AS subject_type,
    p AS predicate,
    COUNT(*) AS edge_count
FROM pqg
WHERE otype = '_edge_'
GROUP BY otype, p
ORDER BY edge_count DESC;
```

**Example output (OpenContext):**
```
subject_type  predicate                  edge_count
_edge_        has_sample_object_type      1,124,480
_edge_        produced_by                 1,096,352
_edge_        has_material_category       1,095,920
_edge_        has_context_category        1,095,912
_edge_        keywords                    1,070,912
```

### Samples per Material Category

```sql
-- How many samples for each material type?
SELECT
    material.label AS material_category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample.pid) AS sample_count
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS material
    ON material.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    AND material.otype = 'IdentifiedConcept'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
GROUP BY material.label
ORDER BY sample_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Geographic Bounding Box

```sql
-- Find extent of all sample locations
SELECT
    MIN(coords.latitude) AS min_lat,
    MAX(coords.latitude) AS max_lat,
    MIN(coords.longitude) AS min_lon,
    MAX(coords.longitude) AS max_lon,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sample.pid) AS sample_count
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id AND edge2.p = 'sample_location'
JOIN pqg AS coords ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND coords.latitude IS NOT NULL
  AND coords.longitude IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## Filtering and Search

### Filter by Material Category

```sql
-- Find all pottery samples
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    material.label AS material_type
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS material
    ON material.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    AND material.otype = 'IdentifiedConcept'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND material.label ILIKE '%pottery%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** Use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive matching, `LIKE` for case-sensitive.

### Filter by Geographic Region

```sql
-- Find samples in Turkey (approximate bounding box)
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    coords.latitude,
    coords.longitude
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id AND edge2.p = 'sample_location'
JOIN pqg AS coords ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND coords.latitude BETWEEN 36.0 AND 42.0
  AND coords.longitude BETWEEN 26.0 AND 45.0
LIMIT 1000;
```

### Filter by Keyword

```sql
-- Find samples with specific keyword
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    keyword.label AS keyword
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'keywords'
JOIN pqg AS keyword
    ON keyword.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    AND keyword.otype = 'IdentifiedConcept'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND keyword.label ILIKE '%neolithic%'
LIMIT 1000;
```

### Combine Multiple Filters

```sql
-- Find pottery samples from Turkey with coordinates
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    material.label AS material,
    coords.latitude,
    coords.longitude
FROM pqg AS sample
-- Material category
JOIN pqg AS mat_edge
    ON mat_edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND mat_edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS material
    ON material.row_id = ANY(mat_edge.o)
    AND material.otype = 'IdentifiedConcept'
-- Coordinates
JOIN pqg AS event_edge
    ON event_edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND event_edge.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event
    ON event.row_id = ANY(event_edge.o)
JOIN pqg AS coord_edge
    ON coord_edge.s = event.row_id
    AND coord_edge.p = 'sample_location'
JOIN pqg AS coords
    ON coords.row_id = ANY(coord_edge.o)
    AND coords.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND material.label ILIKE '%pottery%'
  AND coords.latitude BETWEEN 36.0 AND 42.0
  AND coords.longitude BETWEEN 26.0 AND 45.0
LIMIT 1000;
```

## Complex Query Patterns

### Find Samples Missing Specific Relationships

```sql
-- Samples without material category (quality check)
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label
FROM pqg AS sample
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM pqg AS edge
    WHERE edge.s = sample.row_id
      AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
      AND edge.otype = '_edge_'
  )
LIMIT 1000;
```

### Samples with Multiple Material Categories

```sql
-- Samples categorized as multiple material types
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    ARRAY_AGG(material.label) AS material_categories,
    COUNT(*) AS category_count
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge
    ON edge.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS material
    ON material.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    AND material.otype = 'IdentifiedConcept'
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
GROUP BY sample.pid, sample.label
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY category_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Hierarchical Queries (Parent-Child Samples)

```sql
-- Find child samples and their parents
SELECT
    child.pid AS child_id,
    child.label AS child_label,
    relation.relationship_type,
    parent.pid AS parent_id,
    parent.label AS parent_label
FROM pqg AS child
-- Child → SampleRelation edge
JOIN pqg AS edge1
    ON edge1.s = child.row_id
    AND edge1.p = 'related_resource'
JOIN pqg AS relation
    ON relation.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
    AND relation.otype = 'SampleRelation'
-- SampleRelation → Parent edge
JOIN pqg AS edge2
    ON edge2.s = relation.row_id
    AND edge2.p = 'related_sample'  -- Assuming this predicate exists
JOIN pqg AS parent
    ON parent.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
    AND parent.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
WHERE child.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND relation.relationship_type = 'isPartOf'
LIMIT 1000;
```

### Spatial Proximity Search

```sql
-- Find samples within ~10km of a point (approximate)
-- 1 degree latitude ≈ 111km, 1 degree longitude ≈ 111km * cos(latitude)
WITH target AS (
    SELECT 37.5 AS target_lat, 32.8 AS target_lon  -- Çatalhöyük
)
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    coords.latitude,
    coords.longitude,
    -- Approximate distance in km
    111.0 * SQRT(
        POWER(coords.latitude - target.target_lat, 2) +
        POWER((coords.longitude - target.target_lon) * COS(RADIANS(target.target_lat)), 2)
    ) AS distance_km
FROM pqg AS sample
CROSS JOIN target
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id AND edge2.p = 'sample_location'
JOIN pqg AS coords ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND coords.latitude IS NOT NULL
  AND coords.longitude IS NOT NULL
  AND ABS(coords.latitude - target.target_lat) < 0.1    -- Pre-filter
  AND ABS(coords.longitude - target.target_lon) < 0.1
ORDER BY distance_km
LIMIT 100;
```

**Note:** For precise geospatial calculations, use PostGIS or DuckDB spatial extension.

---

## Performance Optimization

### Use Indexes

```sql
-- Create indexes for common join patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_row_id ON pqg(row_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edge_s ON pqg(s) WHERE otype = '_edge_';
CREATE INDEX idx_edge_p ON pqg(p) WHERE otype = '_edge_';
CREATE INDEX idx_otype ON pqg(otype);
CREATE INDEX idx_pid ON pqg(pid) WHERE otype != '_edge_';
```

### Filter Early

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Filter after all joins
SELECT sample.pid, coords.latitude
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id
JOIN pqg AS coords ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'  -- Too late!
  AND coords.latitude > 40.0;

-- ✅ GOOD: Filter in JOIN conditions
SELECT sample.pid, coords.latitude
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1
    ON edge1.s = sample.row_id
    AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
    AND edge1.otype = '_edge_'
JOIN pqg AS event
    ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
    AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
JOIN pqg AS edge2
    ON edge2.s = event.row_id
    AND edge2.p = 'sample_location'
    AND edge2.otype = '_edge_'
JOIN pqg AS coords
    ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
    AND coords.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'
    AND coords.latitude > 40.0  -- Filter here!
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord';
```

### Use CTEs for Readability

```sql
-- Break complex queries into steps
WITH samples_with_events AS (
    SELECT
        sample.row_id AS sample_row_id,
        sample.pid AS sample_pid,
        sample.label AS sample_label,
        event.row_id AS event_row_id
    FROM pqg AS sample
    JOIN pqg AS edge ON edge.s = sample.row_id AND edge.p = 'produced_by'
    JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
      AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
),
events_with_coords AS (
    SELECT
        swe.sample_row_id,
        swe.sample_pid,
        swe.sample_label,
        coords.latitude,
        coords.longitude
    FROM samples_with_events swe
    JOIN pqg AS edge ON edge.s = swe.event_row_id AND edge.p = 'sample_location'
    JOIN pqg AS coords ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
    WHERE coords.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'
      AND coords.latitude IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM events_with_coords
LIMIT 1000;
```

### Limit Result Sets

```sql
-- Always use LIMIT for exploratory queries
SELECT * FROM pqg LIMIT 1000;  -- ✅

-- Dangerous without LIMIT on large datasets
SELECT * FROM pqg;  -- ❌ Could return millions of rows
```

---

## Common Query Recipes

### Recipe 1: Export Samples with Full Metadata

```sql
-- Complete sample export with all key attributes
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,

    JOIN pqg AS e2 ON e2.s = event.row_id AND e2.p = 'sample_location'
    WHERE e1.s = sample.row_id AND e1.p = 'produced_by'
  );
```

### Recipe 3: Generate GeoJSON

```sql
-- Create GeoJSON for web mapping
SELECT json_object(
    'type', 'FeatureCollection',
    'features', json_group_array(
        json_object(
            'type', 'Feature',
            'geometry', json_object(
                'type', 'Point',
                'coordinates', json_array(coords.longitude, coords.latitude)
            ),
            'properties', json_object(
                'id', sample.pid,
                'label', sample.label,
                'material', material.label
            )
        )
    )
) AS geojson
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS mat_edge ON mat_edge.s = sample.row_id AND mat_edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS material ON material.row_id = ANY(mat_edge.o)

WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND coords.latitude IS NOT NULL
  AND coords.longitude IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1000;

  AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
  AND event.event_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY collection_year
ORDER BY collection_year;
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Always filter by `otype`** in JOIN conditions for performance
2. **Use `ANY(edge.o)`** to handle multi-valued predicates correctly
3. **Start simple** - test single-hop queries before chaining multiple relationships
4. **Use CTEs** to break down complex queries into understandable steps
5. **Add LIMIT** to all exploratory queries
6. **Check for NULL values** in coordinate and date fields
7. **Use LEFT JOIN** when relationships are optional
8. **Explain your queries** with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` to optimize performance
9. **Batch queries** when possible instead of running thousands individually
10. **Document your patterns** - complex graph traversals are hard to remember!
