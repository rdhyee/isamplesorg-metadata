# Understanding the iSamples Property Graph

**Purpose:** This guide helps you understand how iSamples metadata is structured as a property graph, making it easier to query, validate, and work with material sample data.

**Key Insight:** The iSamples property graph has a well-defined **grammar** consisting of 8 entity types and 14 relationship types. Understanding this grammar is essential for working with PQG-formatted data.

## What is a Property Graph?

A **property graph** represents data as:
- **Nodes** (entities with properties)
- **Edges** (relationships between nodes)

**Why use a graph?**
- Captures complex relationships naturally
- Enables flexible multi-hop queries
- Supports domain-agnostic modeling
- Facilitates data integration across sources

**iSamples Graph Example:**
```
MaterialSampleRecord (pottery sherd)
    |
    |-- produced_by --> SamplingEvent (2023 excavation)
    |                       |
    |                       |-- sampling_site --> SamplingSite (Çatalhöyük)
    |                       |                         |
    |                       |                         |-- site_location --> GeospatialCoordLocation
    |                       |
    |                       |-- sample_location --> GeospatialCoordLocation
    |                       |
    |                       |-- responsibility --> Agent (Dr. Smith)
    |
    |-- has_material_category --> IdentifiedConcept (Earthenware)
    |
    |-- keywords --> IdentifiedConcept (Neolithic, Pottery)
```

## The 8 Entity Types (oTypes)

These are the **node types** in the iSamples graph. Each node has an `otype` field that identifies its type.

### 1. MaterialSampleRecord

**What it represents:** The physical sample itself - the core entity in iSamples.

**Domain examples:**

- `sample_identifier` - Canonical sample ID

**Required relationships:**
- Must have `produced_by` → SamplingEvent
- Must have `has_material_category` → IdentifiedConcept
- Must have `has_context_category` → IdentifiedConcept
- Must have `has_sample_object_type` → IdentifiedConcept

**Example:**

## Why This Structure?

### Multi-Hop Traversal by Design

**Finding a sample's coordinates requires multiple hops:**

```
MaterialSampleRecord
    → produced_by → SamplingEvent
        → sample_location → GeospatialCoordLocation
```

**Why not store coordinates directly on the sample?**

✅ **Benefits of separation:**
1. **Shared locations** - Multiple samples from same event share one coordinate
2. **Different precision** - Site coordinates vs exact sample coordinates
3. **Reusable events** - One event can produce many samples
4. **Flexible modeling** - Some samples have site but not precise coords

❌ **Drawbacks of flat structure:**
- Duplicate coordinates across samples
- Can't distinguish site-level vs sample-level precision
- Harder to maintain data consistency

### Domain-Agnostic Design

The 8 entity types work across **all scientific domains**:

- **Archaeology:** Pottery, bones, charcoal → Terrestrial/Archaeological context
- **Geology:** Cores, outcrops, minerals → Terrestrial/Subsurface context
- **Biology:** Tissue, DNA, specimens → Marine Biome or Terrestrial context

**Same schema, different values** - This is true domain-agnostic modeling.

### Graph Query Flexibility

**Example queries enabled by graph structure:**

1. "Find all samples collected by Agent X"
   - `MaterialSampleRecord → produced_by → SamplingEvent → responsibility → Agent`

2. "Find all samples within 10km of a location"
   - `MaterialSampleRecord → produced_by → SamplingEvent → sample_location → GeospatialCoordLocation`

3. "Find all earthenware samples with keywords 'Neolithic' AND 'pottery'"
   - `MaterialSampleRecord → has_material_category → IdentifiedConcept` (Earthenware)
   - `MaterialSampleRecord → keywords → IdentifiedConcept` (Neolithic, Pottery)

4. "Find parent sample for a given subsample"
   - `MaterialSampleRecord → related_resource → SampleRelation` (where relationship="derivedFrom")

---

## Graph Traversal Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sample → Coordinates (2-3 hops)

**Path:**
```
Sample → produced_by → Event → sample_location → Coords
```

**SQL example:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.pid AS sample_id,
    coords.latitude,
    coords.longitude
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id AND edge2.p = 'sample_location'
JOIN pqg AS coords ON coords.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
```

### Pattern 2: Sample → Site Name (3 hops)

**Path:**
```
Sample → produced_by → Event → sampling_site → Site
```

**SQL example:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    site.label AS site_name,
    site.place_name
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id AND edge2.p = 'sampling_site'
JOIN pqg AS site ON site.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
```

### Pattern 3: Sample → Collector (2-3 hops)

**Path:**
```
Sample → produced_by → Event → responsibility → Agent
```

**SQL example:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.label AS sample_label,
    agent.name AS collector_name,
    event.result_time
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge1 ON edge1.s = sample.row_id AND edge1.p = 'produced_by'
JOIN pqg AS event ON event.row_id = ANY(edge1.o)
JOIN pqg AS edge2 ON edge2.s = event.row_id AND edge2.p = 'responsibility'
JOIN pqg AS agent ON agent.row_id = ANY(edge2.o)
WHERE sample.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
```

### Pattern 4: Material Type Filter (1 hop)

**Path:**
```
Sample → has_material_category → Concept
```

**SQL example:**
```sql
SELECT
    sample.pid,
    sample.label,
    concept.label AS material_type
FROM pqg AS sample
JOIN pqg AS edge ON edge.s = sample.row_id AND edge.p = 'has_material_category'
JOIN pqg AS concept ON concept.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
WHERE concept.label = 'Earthenware'
```

---

## Storage Format

### Unified Table Structure

PQG stores **both nodes and edges in a single table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pqg (
    row_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pid VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    otype VARCHAR,  -- Node type or '_edge_'

    -- Edge fields (NULL for non-edge nodes)
    s INTEGER,      -- Subject row_id
    p VARCHAR,      -- Predicate
    o INTEGER[],    -- Object row_id(s)
    n VARCHAR,      -- Named graph

    -- Entity properties (NULL for edges)
    label VARCHAR,
    description TEXT,
    latitude DECIMAL,
    longitude DECIMAL,
    elevation VARCHAR,
    ...
);
```

### Node Rows

**Example: MaterialSampleRecord node**
```
row_id: 1
pid: "igsn:SSH000001"
otype: "MaterialSampleRecord"
s: NULL
p: NULL
o: NULL
n: NULL
label: "Ceramic bowl fragment"
description: "Red-slipped pottery..."
```

### Edge Rows

**Example: produced_by edge**
```
row_id: 1001
pid: "edge_12345"
otype: "_edge_"
s: 1        (sample row_id)
p: "produced_by"
o: [2]      (event row_id)
n: NULL
label: NULL
description: NULL
```

### Query Pattern

**Find all edges of a specific type:**
```sql
SELECT
    subject.pid AS subject_pid,
    edge.p AS predicate,
    object.pid AS object_pid
FROM pqg AS edge
JOIN pqg AS subject ON edge.s = subject.row_id
JOIN pqg AS object ON object.row_id = ANY(edge.o)
WHERE edge.otype = '_edge_'
  AND subject.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'
  AND edge.p = 'produced_by'
  AND object.otype = 'SamplingEvent'
```
